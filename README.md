🔍 Simple Port Scanner (with GUI)
Ever wondered which ports are open on a website or a local server? This beginner-friendly desktop app lets you scan for open ports on any host, all from a clean and interactive interface — no command-line headaches!

💡 What It Does
Scans a custom range of ports on a given host (e.g., 20-80).

Shows whether each port is ✅ Open or ❌ Closed.

Displays common port services (e.g., 80 → HTTP, 443 → HTTPS).

Gives you a neat progress bar and live scan updates.

Lets you export results to a .txt file.

Includes a ✨ Dark Mode toggle for better UX.
